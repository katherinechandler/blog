Hi, Iâ€˜m Katherine! I have a PhD in biological chemistry and have worked as a scientist in the environmental field for the past 5 years. Now I'm *slightly* shifting gears and honing my data science skills in the K2 Data Science bootcamp. I recently relocated back to my hometown of Salt Lake City and my hobbies include making pottery, cooking with butter, and pampering my cat Kevin. I love traveling to lesser visited destinations and spent 2017 roaming from Tokyo to Marrakech, visiting 27 countries along the way and writing about my <a href = 'https://alldifferentroads.com/' target="_blank">adventures</a>!
